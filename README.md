# About myself
My name is Anika Baro Villa, and Iâ€™m currently a Computer Science senior. I'm passionate about programming, and I love the creative challenge that comes with writing code. Beyond my love for tech, I'm also deeply interested in art, where I find inspiration and a way to express myself outside of the digital world. In my free time, I cherish moments spent with my family as they are my biggest support and source of joy.
